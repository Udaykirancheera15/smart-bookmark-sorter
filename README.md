# Smart Bookmark Sorter

## Overview
The Smart Bookmark Sorter is a simple browser extension I created for Firefox to help manage the overwhelming number of bookmarks cluttering my toolbar. Frustrated by the disorganization, I developed this extension to meet my own needs. This project serves as a demonstration of the fundamentals of browser extension development, showcasing how to structure the extension, interact with browser APIs, and manage user interfaces. As a curious student, I aimed to deepen my understanding of how extensions function and how to implement their basic features.

## Features

- Simple user interface for sorting bookmarks.
- Built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Thanks to the Firefox Developer documentation for providing valuable resources on building extensions. My curiosity and willingness to learn have made me to do this simple extension to know how it works and solving the problem I faced, and I look forward to expanding its capabilities in the future.
